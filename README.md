early-ssh
=========

early-ssh gives you an SSH server during the boot of your Linux system. It starts before the root filesystem is mounted so you can unlock your encrypted root filesystem remotely.

early-ssh is basically an update-iniramfs hook script and a boot script that starts the dropbear SSH server in the initramfs during boot.

Features
--------

### SCP to the server
You can copy files to the server using scp from a remote host. This enables you to copy key files to unlock key-based LUKS even for the root filesystem.

### Dedicated root password
It is possible to use a different root password than the one use on your system (it can be disabled as well) by adding a `SHADOW_OVERRIDE` option specifying a different shadow file.

See `PASSWD_OVERRIDE`, `SHADOW_OVERRIDE`, `GROUP_OVERRIDE` in config.

Example: `SHADOW_OVERRIDE="/etc/early-ssh/shadow"`

### Timeout to continue the boot
A timeout can be specified to continue the boot after a certain time.

See `TIMEOUT` in config.

Example: `TIMEOUT=600`

### Specify network interface by MAC address
If you have more than one network interface and they get scrambled on boot it is possible to specify the correct interface by MAC address instead of the name ("eth0" for example).

See `IFACE` in config.

Example: `IFACE="MAC 01:02:03:04:05:06"`

### Put your ssh server on a different port
You can move the early-ssh server on a different port.

See `PORT` in config.

Example: `PORT=2233`


A real-life example with RAID-1 and LUKS
----------------------------------------

content of zaphod-init.sh
```
#!/bin/sh

# load the RAID-1 module for mdadm
modprobe raid1

# create the md special devices
for i in 0 1 2 3; do mknod /dev/md${i} b 9 ${i}; done

# scan for all mdadm arrays (can be good if you forget to update your initramfs)
mdadm --examine --scan > /tmp/mdadm.conf

# assemble the RAID-1 arrays
mdadm --assemble --scan --config /tmp/mdadm.conf

# load the dm-crypt module for LUKS
modprobe dm-crypt

# do the LUKS openings (md0 is the /boot, so it is not encrypted!)
for i in 1 2 3; do cryptsetup --key-file /tmp/zaphod-md${i}.key luksOpen /dev/md${i} md${i}_crypt; done
```

An SSH session:
```
mobilem00:/mnt/pendrive# scp zaphod-init/* root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/tmp
root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx's password:

zaphod-md2.key                                 100%  256     0.3KB/s   00:00
zaphod-md3.key                                 100%  256     0.3KB/s   00:00

mobilem00:/mnt/pendrive# ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
