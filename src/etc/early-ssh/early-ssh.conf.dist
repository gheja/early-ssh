# "INTERFACE" can also be a MAC address. If the MAC address is not found on any
# interfaces the first one will be used (eth0) - this can avoid cases where a
# network card change would render a system unreachable.
# INTERFACE="MAC 01:02:03:04:05:06"

# By default the early-ssh copies the "root" user entry from the passwd, shadow
# and group files (also replaces the /bin/bash shell to /bin/sh). If that is not
# wanted (e.g. early-ssh "root" user should use a different password or shell)
# here you can configure the specific passwd, shadow and group files by
# uncommenting and configuring the following lines and creating the files.
# PASSWD_OVERRIDE="/etc/early-ssh/passwd"
# SHADOW_OVERRIDE="/etc/early-ssh/shadow"
# GROUP_OVERRIDE="/etc/early-ssh/group"

# By default early-ssh copies the host's dropbear host's keys. The directory
# containing the host keys may be overriden below.
# HOSTKEYDIR_OVERRIDE="/etc/early-ssh/"

# By default early-ssh copies the root user's authorized_keys file. The
# authorized_keys file may be overriden below. Please ensure the file is
# owned by user or root, and not writable by group or others. (i.e. `chmod
# 600 ...`)
# AUTHKEY_OVERRIDE="/etc/early-ssh/authorized_keys"
